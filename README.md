Hello guys this Repo is for everyone who wants to contribute to making a pokemon bot for telegram. 

# What do you need to do?

pokemons_list.json is an example file for all the pokemon stats format.

first what we are going to do is add all the pokemon with their stats in pokemons.json

According to the order of the pokemon in the official game.

I will merge the pull requests as soon as possible. 

# Like in pokemons.json 

**Pokemon with 3 evolution we will be like this**

- Bulbasaur has 2 moves
- Ivysaur has 3 moves
- Venusaur has 4 moves

**Pokemon with 2 evolution we will**

- first evolution will have 3 moves
- second and last evolution will have 4 moves

**Pokemon with only 1 evolution**

- It will have 4 moves

So make sure to add moves like that

To get pokemon moves and stats

I suggest

- Datadex from play store

# Things to note before Pull Request

- Don't make pull requests for too many pokemon.
- Only Gen 1 pokemon for now.
- 5-10 pokemon per pull request is acceptable. 
- you can also do like this, make pull request of Pidgey + Rattata pokemon.
